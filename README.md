# E-Commerce

This is a mock E-commerce app I've built as a final project for SE-016 Web Applications course at Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences.
This app does NOT have any log in - sign up functions, and it does not use any real payment API's.

These user stories are for the assignment.

### User Stories

#### 1 - As a user, I want to be able to shop online so that I won't have to go to the store.

#### 2 - As a user, I want a wishlist so that I can buy the items when I have the money.

#### 3 - As a user, I want to be able to see the items in my cart so that I can see how much I am spending.

#### 4 - As an admin, I want to be able to add items to the store so that users can buy them.

#### 5 - As an admin, I want a dashboard so that I can see how much money I am making.
